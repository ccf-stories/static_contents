		<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
		<p>
			Since 2002, the Children's Cardiomyopathy Foundation (CCF) has focused on accelerating the search for causes
			and cures for pediatric cardiomyopathy through increased research, education, awareness, and advocacy. CCF's
			informational and emotional support services and resources have helped families to advocate for accurate
			diagnosis, improved treatment, and better quality of life for their affected child. The hope is that
			cardiomyopathy will be detected earlier, more lives will be saved, and all children with the disease will
			live full and active lives.
		</p>

		<p><strong>About Stories from the Heart</strong></p>

		<p>
			The Children's Cardiomyopathy Foundation (CCF) recognizes the value of giving voice to patients living with
			a chronic condition. Every family's story is unique and matters. CCF developed Stories from the Heart to
			encourage patients and family members to talk about their experience with cardiomyopathy. The self-guided
			recording program helps to facilitate more communication and understanding among patients, families, and
			doctors. As experiences are shared, affected families can inform and influence people to learn more about
			pediatric cardiomyopathy.

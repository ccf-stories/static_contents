                accessible through our Website and Services, please select the "Public" setting on your App. In the
                "Public" setting, your Story Content will automatically be posted on CCF's Website, will be available
                for the general public to view, and is searchable and viewable by App users when you engage the

                as text and email. If you wish not to share your Story Content publicly, you may save a draft of your

                also select the "Unlisted" option in the App settings prior to recording your story. The Unlisted

                designated as "Unlisted" is not searchable via the App and will not be posted by CCF on its webpage.
                However, keep in mind that once you share a link with others, those recipients </span><span

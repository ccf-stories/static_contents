		<p><strong>Pick a Topic</strong></p>
		<p>
			Get an idea of what you would like to talk about by browsing category topics and viewing a list of prompts.
			Pick a prompt that reminds you of a memorable incident or event. It can also be a topic that allows you to
			convey your emotions. Your topic should be narrow enough that you can tell your full story in 15 minutes. To
			engage your audience, try to convey all aspects of the experience, such as what happened, who was there, how
			did you feel, what were you thinking, what was the environment like, and why the experience was meaningful,
			difficult, or important.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Determine How to Tell Your Story</strong></p>
		<p>
			Think about how you want to tell your story. Do you prefer to be alone when recording or would you rather
			have a conversation with a friend or loved one? Will guided prompts help you express yourself or do you feel
			it is more natural to talk openly? Perhaps an object, photograph, or song will bring to mind memories and
			feelings that you can organize into a story.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Prepare Your Outline of Prompts</strong></p>
		<p>
			Use our suggested prompts to create an outline or write your own questions. Alternatively, you can organize
			your thoughts on paper. However, it's best to speak freely rather than read from an outline so that your
			story flows naturally. Our app allows you to select up to 4 prompts with a total recording time of 15
			minutes. If you pick 4 prompts you have about 3 to 4 minutes per question. You can always skip some prompts
			to keep on track.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Get Inspired to Talk</strong></p>
		<p>
			The more meaningful stories often touch upon the emotions surrounding an event. Instead of only focusing on
			the facts of what happened, try to go deeper and reveal your joy, sadness, fears, and surprises. Sometimes a
			quote, poem, song, photograph, or special keepsake can help you reflect and find inspiration.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Create Time and Space for Yourself</strong></p>
		<p>
			Pick a quiet, comfortable spot to tell your story. Try to remove yourself from your daily activities to
			allow time for reflection. Find a place where there is no background noise like air conditioners, loud
			heaters and appliances, or traffic. Make sure you've scheduled enough time so that you don't feel rushed or
			distracted. Silence all notifications or turn off cell phones and other devices.

		<p><strong>Prepare Your Space</strong></p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Find a quiet place free from distractions and disruptions.</li>
			<li>Block out enough time so you don't feel rushed.</li>
			<li>Turn off buzzing lights, air conditioners, and other loud machinery.</li>
			<li>Close windows to minimize traffic or outside noise.</li>
			<li>Mute or turn off your phone or any devices in the room.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Set Up and Check Your Device</strong></p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Do a quick audio check with the recording function on your phone. Play it back to make sure it's working
				and recording clearly.</li>
			<li>Position your phone within 6-8 inches of your voice either with a stand or by holding it. When recording
				with someone else decide who will hold the phone to prevent background noise.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Consider Your Timing</strong></p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Monitor your recording to stay within the allotted 15-minute time limit.</li>
			<li>Determine how many minutes you'll spend on each topic.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Introduce Yourself and the Person You Are Interviewing</strong></p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>State your first and last name, location, and your diagnosis if you are comfortable sharing this
				information.</li>
			<li>State your association with the diagnosed.</li>
			<li>If you are recording with someone, they should state their relationship to you, such as "My name is
				Julie. I'm with my cousin John in Tampa, Florida. John was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy when he was 5
				years old."</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p><strong>State the Question or Prompt Before Your Response or Weave the Question Back into Your
				Answer</strong></p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Give the listener context whenever possible, such as "Talk about what it felt like when you received
				your diagnosis." Your response might be, "When I received my diagnosis my immediate feeling was..."</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Relax and Tell Your Story</strong></p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Be comfortable when you share your story.</li>
			<li>Remember that you can pause at any time to collect your thoughts.</li>
			<li>You can re-record if you don't like your story. Your recording will not be posted until you press
				'Publish' so you can do as many recordings as you would like.</li>
		</ul>

			Cardiomyopathy is a chronic disease that deeply impacts families. Feelings of confusion, anxiety, and
			depression are common when first diagnosed whether it is yourself or someone close to you. Telling your
			story is therapeutic in that it allows you to make sense of your experience and see beyond your situation.
			Capturing your experience and expressing your feelings helps to cope with the challenges of living with a
			chronic disease. Similarly, hearing the stories of others with cardiomyopathy promotes feelings of
			solidarity, understanding, and hope. By telling your story, you can move beyond any difficulties associated
			with cardiomyopathy and help others along in their journey with the disease.

		<p><strong>It Helps Others</strong></p>

		<p>
			Recording your story benefits many people. It provides an honest account of what it is like to live with
			cardiomyopathy, and it preserves your story for future generations. Sharing your experience encourages
			patients and families in similar situations to come together and support each other. It also helps to raise
			public awareness of a disease that many may not be familiar with. Your family's perspective on care will
			benefit physicians trying to improve diagnosis and medical management. This could translate to better care
			guidelines, treatment options, and improved health outcomes for other patients.
